This directory is intended for PlatformIO Test Runner and project tests.

Unit Testing is a software testing method by which individual units of
source code, sets of one or more MCU program modules together with associated
control data, usage procedures, and operating procedures, are tested to
determine whether they are fit for use. Unit testing finds problems early
in the development cycle.

## Project Description

This system is designed for divers using heated drysuits. It manages and controls the heating elements connected to a 12V battery supply. The system can control multiple heating zones, such as:
- Main body heating
- Heated gloves

Temperature sensors are strategically placed:
- One sensor on the chest area
- One sensor on the hand

This setup allows for precise temperature control and monitoring during dives, ensuring diver comfort and safety in cold water conditions.

## Testing Environment

The testing setup includes verification of:
- 12V power supply management
- Temperature sensor readings (chest and hand sensors)
- Heating element control for multiple zones (main heating and gloves)
- Safety cutoffs and temperature limits
- Battery voltage monitoring

Please ensure all safety-related tests are performed thoroughly before deployment in diving conditions.
